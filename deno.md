excerpt: Are alternative runtimes, ready for production TS?
---
I'm preparing a deno talk

The idea is to migrate an existing production grade service from lambdas to deno.deploy

Something akin to

Postgres > PG > db.ts > hander.ts (yup) > controller.ts > http.ts (express)

Outcomes being

Postgres > Kysely > db.ts > handler.ts (zod) > controller.ts > http.ts (something?)

I plan to benchmark some options

1. Node
	1. Express
	2. Fastify
	3. Koa
2. Bun
	2. Express
	3. Fastify
	4. Koa
4. Deno
	2. Express
	3. Fastify
	4. Koa
	5. Others
		1. Reason why?
			1. Security
			2. Documentation
			3. Ease of use
			4. Type Safety
			5. Actively maintained
			6. Scalability
			7. Maturity
		2. Hono
		3. Oak
		4. Alosaur
		5. Pogo
		6. Aqua

Also
TRPC
1. Node
2. Bun
3. Deno
