<h2>My background in programming and Machine Learning</h2>
<p>I have enjoyed programming since I was very young around 13 years old. I started learning Delphi at High School, then C++ and Matlab at University. While I was working, I developed my Excel skills significantly and I learnt VBA in Excel. In 2019, I started teaching myself Python. I really enjoyed automating processes and I started writing scripts to make my monotonous work less effort.</p>

<p>When I looked into Data Science in Python, I realised there was a lot of overlap with what I had been doing during my career (with trend monitoring, troubleshooting, regression, process models). I became really interested in Data Science and Machine Learning and started to learn this in my spare time. My partner works in air quality and human health and she was able  I have developed a few repositories. A lot of the repositories that I have worked on contain confidential information (human health) so they need to remain Private. There is too much to add to my LinkedIn page, so I thought it would be a better idea to separate it for anyone who was interested to read it.</p>
