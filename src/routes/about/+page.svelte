  <h2> Some stuff about me / thoughts I have </h2>
  
  <li>I have an unhealthy relationship with optimisation - you know when you optimise for an event that'll never happen? 🚤</li>
  <li>Definitely a dog person 🐕</li>
  <li>True mechanical keyboard endgame is split low profile without row stagger</li>
    <li>Colemak-dh ⌨️ over Workman over Dvorak</li>
  <li>I'm an advocate for simplicity as far as possible 👍</li>
  <li>I am currently a Fullstack Tech Lead at Peach Payments 🥞</li>
  <li>I also run the Remix-JHB meetup and React.Africa 🚀</li>
  <li>Framework wars are a distraction. </li>
  <li>But also, I really like Solidjs</li>
  <li>This was built with Sveltekit, and was updated after the change from file-based to folder-based routing.</li>
  <li>SFCs are great, they remind me of Vue, wich I really enjoyed</li>
