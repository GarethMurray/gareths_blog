# Some stuff about me / thoughts I have

- I have an unhealthy relationship with optimisation - you know when you optimise for an event that'll never happen? 🚤
- Definitely a dog person 🐕
- True mechanical keyboard endgame is split low profile without row stagger
  - Colemak-dh ⌨️ over Workman over Dvorak
- I'm an advocate for simplicity as far as possible 👍
- I am currently a Fullstack Tech Lead at Peach Payments 🥞
- I also run the Remix-JHB meetup and React.Africa 🚀
- React is good, Nextjs is great. Preact is underrated and I'd love to see how Fresh holds up to production level loads. 
- I enjoy Sveltekit - even after the folder (not file) based routing changes, while it feels lacks some maturity🤷‍♂️ Working with SFCs reminds me of Vue, wich I enjoy
- SolidStart is the black horse to watch
- I prefer tailwindcss to css-in-js or styled components. But I want to support Windicss because they're driving incredible innovation - also Unocss which is gonna be 🐐
- Also, I like emojis
