# Junior to Senior
## 6 Lessons I Learned Along the Way

As a developer, there is always a sense of pressure to be at the top of your game. The journey from a junior developer to a senior developer can be a challenging one, but it is also an incredibly rewarding experience. Through my own journey, I have learned several valuable lessons that I want to share with others who are also on the path to becoming a senior developer.

### 1.  Do not fear failure: 
One of the most important lessons I have learned on my journey is that failure is a natural part of the learning process, and it is essential to embrace it and learn from it. When I started my developer career, I was scared of failing. I was afraid of making mistakes and looking foolish in front of my colleagues. However, as I progressed in my career, I realized that failure is not something to be feared but rather something to be embraced. The more I failed, the more I learned, and the more I grew as a developer. It is important to remember that failure is not the end; it is just an opportunity to learn and improve.

#### 2. Consistency trumps explosive effort: 
Another lesson I have learned is that consistency trumps explosive effort. In the early days of my career, in fact, even until recently, I used to work long hours and burn myself out. I thought that by working harder and longer, I would be able to achieve more. However, I soon realized that this approach was not sustainable and that it would not get me very far. The key is to maintain a consistent pace, even when things get tough. Instead of working long hours and burning yourself out, it's better to work consistently and make steady progress. By working consistently, you'll be able to achieve more in the long run.

### 3. Repetition is key to fluency: 
As a developer, you are constantly learning new technologies and programming languages. One of the most important lessons I have learned is that repetition is key to fluency. In order to become proficient in a new technology or programming language, you need to practice it over and over again. The more you practice, the better you will become. Repetition is the key to fluency, and the more you practice, the more comfortable you will feel with the new technology or language.

### 4. Always ask why:
As a developer, it's critical to understand the reasoning as to why things are done in certain ways. One of the most valuable lessons I have learned is to always ask why. By asking why, you'll gain a deeper understanding of the problem you're trying to solve and come up with better solutions. Asking why will help you to understand the underlying principles and concepts that are at play, which will allow you to make better decisions and write better code.

### 5. Talk about your thoughts: 
Another important lesson I have learned is the importance of sharing your ideas and thoughts with others. As a developer, it's essential to get feedback on your work and to learn from others. Collaboration is key to growth as a developer. By sharing your thoughts and ideas with others, you'll be able to get a different perspective on your work and learn from others' experiences.

### 6. Don't get too hung up on trends: 
Lastly, I have learned that it's important to not get too hung up on trends. Technology is constantly evolving, and it can be easy to get caught up in the latest trends. However, it's important to focus on what's important and to not get too hung up on the latest and greatest technology. Instead, focus on the fundamentals and the principles that underlie the technology you're working with. This will give you a solid foundation that will last you throughout your career, regardless of the latest trends. By not getting too hung up on trends, you'll be able to make more informed decisions and build better, more sustainable systems.

In conclusion, becoming a senior developer takes time, hard work, and consistency. By following these lessons, you'll be well on your way to reaching your goals. Remember that failure is a natural part of the process, and that it's essential to learn from it. Keep working hard and stay consistent, and you'll get there in no time. Keep in mind that it is a journey, not a destination, and you will always be learning and growing as a developer.
