excerpt: My academic career
---
I have a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree:
- B.Eng Chemical Engineering
- M.Eng Engineering Management

I chose the M.Eng Engineering Management as I wanted to focus a bit more on project processes but I didn't want to move out of the technical field. I then decided that the M.Eng was a nice combination of technical and management/project management.
