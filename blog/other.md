## Non-Data Science activities
I've recently been playing with home automation. It is difficult at times as we are still renting so I can't really install anything permanent. My automations include:
1. Automated message to my partner when I leave work stating the duration of my trip based on current traffic and the time I will arrive home.
2. Turn on my coffee machine when I am 10 minutes from home.
3. My rice cooker would burn the rice when on the "stay warm" setting, so as soon as the rice cooker draws below 50W of power, it turn cut the power.
