excerpt: Things that I like to do in my free time
---
I enjoy cooking, and would say this is one of my primary hobbies. I enjoy trying new recipes, making sourdough bread, making fermented foods and hotsauces. I enjoy going to gym and in my spare time, I like to walk the dogs in the park, watch series or anime, work on my home automation system or game on the computer. I would like to get into snowboarding, which I enjoyed but was not really able to do in South Africa. I used to do boxing, so I am looking for a boxing gym to go to when things settle down.
