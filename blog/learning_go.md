# My progress with go

Go is often touted as being simple and idiomatic, but I feel it's quite verbose. There is of course the nature of a language which is closer to the system level, but it's worth considering. One of the reasons I think Svelte is a safe option it's brevity - I am a believer in more lines of code being more opportunities for error.

The more I learn go, the more I am starting to appreciate interfaces. While I generally feel uncomfortable working with classes, the idea of attaching methods to an interface which can be applied in a generic fashion makes for a very useful tool. This has leaked out into the way I think about working in Typescript, and I think it's a good thing.
