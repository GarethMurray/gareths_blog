## Data for WHO database 
I wrote a script that would scrape data from a website using POST requests and I cleaned the data. My data helped to create one of the largest coherent ambient air quality datasets in Africa, which has been/ is being used in a number of environmental health studies. This work resulted in an acknowledgement in the [*World Health Organisation (WHO) ambient air quality database, 2022 update - Status report*](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/368432/9789240047693-eng.pdf?sequence=1)

After I scraped and cleaned the data above, it was used in the article below, which was published in "Annals of Global Health
