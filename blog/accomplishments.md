## Contributions to WHOâ€™s Air Quality Database: Ambient Air Quality in South Africa
In the domain of environmental health, robust data sets are indispensable. It was with this understanding that I took on the challenge of gathering and refining ambient air quality data for South Africa. Utilizing POST requests, I wrote a script that scraped the necessary data from a particular website. The subsequent arduous data cleansing process ensured the data's reliability and coherence.

The significance of this work was acknowledged in the [*World Health Organisation (WHO) ambient air quality database, 2022 update - Status report*](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/368432/9789240047693-eng.pdf?sequence=1). It has the distinction of being among the largest coherent ambient air quality datasets in Africa and serves as a cornerstone for various environmental health studies.

## Contributing Data to Journal Publication: The Orofacial Cleft Study 
Subsequent to the data collection and cleansing efforts, the data was used in an article published in "Annals of Global Health" (Impact Factor: 3.64). Titled [*"The Risk of Orofacial Cleft Lip/Palate Due to Maternal Ambient Air Pollution Exposure: A Call for Further Research in South Africa"*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9881443/). The link between high air pollution in South Africa and the geographic prevalence of orofacial cleft lip/palate (CLP) in neonates as investigated.
